1) I have data from runs 7129--7136, rings 9--15. 
2) From run to run, the extraction begin time changes from 3 seconds to 4.75 seconds by .25 seconds; uptime is 2 seconds in each case.
3) At each extraction setting (excluding run 7132) the polarization data varies from ring to ring; run 7132 (extraction begin time 3.75 s) --- all rings yield polarization 0 with probability 75%.
4) K-nearest neighbor w/8 clusters clustering. Data = (Run, Ring, P0), Run+Ring explain 85% of the point variability.
5) PCA shows that all the variability of the polarization data can be explained by the Run and Ring variables; Run explains 57% of the data variance, Ring 43%.
6) Cross-ratio data behave better: when plotted against extraction time, between 3 and 4 seconds, cr0 seems to fall for all rings; from 4 seconds onward, cr0 grows rapidly for all rings.
7) Looks like up until 4s, cr decreases with lifetime 16.7s, and after that grows with the lifetime of 3s.
8) When plotted against ring number, cr grows (robust least squares) with ring number for almost all runs, except 7132, 7134 and 7136 (slope t-value resp. 1.362 (p=10.5%), .208 (42%) and .128 (45%)).
9) K-means clustering, Run+Ring explain 88.25% of variability; three clusters overlap significantly, the rest seem to be identified okay.
